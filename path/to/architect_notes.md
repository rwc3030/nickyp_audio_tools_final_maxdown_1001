# Architect Notes

## Remaining Features and Tasks
- Review 'checklist.md' for the next task. **Status: In Progress**

## Code Duplication and Cleanup Actions
1. **Redundant Functionality**: The `setDefaultValues` function is implemented in multiple control classes (e.g., `CompressionControl`, `EQControl`, `ReverbControl`, `LimiterControl`). This could be refactored into a base class to reduce code duplication.
2. **Similar Painting Logic**: The `paint` function in several control classes (e.g., `CompressionControl`, `EQControl`, `ReverbControl`, `LimiterControl`) contains similar logic for rendering. This could be abstracted into a common method to streamline the painting process.
3. **Extreme Value Handling**: The `handleExtremeValues` function is also repeated across multiple classes with similar logic. This could be centralized to improve maintainability.
